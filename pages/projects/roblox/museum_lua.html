                        This creation is uncopylocked, meaning anyone from Roblox can fork the game and look inside the program. From cloning to animation
                        to data-saving and more, the Museum of LUA can guide and assist individuals that want to code on Roblox by revealing the different
                        things they can learn and apply to their own game.

                        I wanted to script this experience to help others learn, but also to document the personal learning that I was doing. Many these lessons 
                        came from TheDevKing, an experienced Roblox developer who I knew could help me become more knowledgeable with LUA. If there
                        was something I didn't understand, I would also go on the Roblox DevForums and ask others about the material.

                        In general, Roblox Development has really taught me how to discipline myself to keep pushing past concepts that I did not totally understand
                        at first. It's also very easy to publish your game on Roblox for anyone to play, which allowed me to get feedback from my friends on what 
                        else I should be adding to the game. Of course, my games are not perfect and there are likely still bugs, but for me, Roblox Studio was a huge 
                        step in the right direction for my personal development.
