                        My goal is to make this website dynamic and fun to navigate around. Therefore, you may notice a few things such as how there are animations as
                        you scroll down, or even a few easter eggs. This website is also mobile-responsive, allowing most people to surf around my portfolio no matter 
                        the device.

                        Critiverse is one of my first ever programming projects, which I made as a new Highschool Freshman and ended up really enjoying. Although some concepts were 
                        taught in class, such as borders and padding, the features of my website mostly came from my own research and learning how to google things I didn't understand 
                        at first. Then I had to figure out how to implement these new concepts to make my website even better and more efficient.

                        Learning web development was instrumental for me: I found I was able to express my creative nature, being able to build anything I could think of. It was 
                        the basis that gave me the passion for learning how things work, allowing me to expand to different areas of computer science, such as robotics with 
                        Java and even cybersecurity! The reason I'm able to innovate and take action started here, and without web development, I would have never gotten a foothold 
                        to grow and become my greatest self.
