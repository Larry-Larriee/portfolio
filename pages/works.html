                    Now that I knew the disiplines of programming, I begun to become more interested in my childhood game Roblox.
                    I came interested in how different games worked and behaved and learned about <cite>Roblox Studio</cite>

                    At first I felt very lost in terms of Roblox scripting. However, as I started to take free public 
                    models on Roblox, I got more used to the environment and began learning from Youtubers like Alvinblox and TheDevKing.
                    It's difficult to do things by yourself and these people acted as essentially mentors for me.

                    more and more about things like animations, lighting, client and server events, player scripts, workspace scripts, and more.
