                    I decided to take an Exploring Computer Science (ECS) class that my school offered me. In this class, I would learn about how
                    websites were built as well as a little bit of HTML and CSS.

                    Now that I knew the disciplines of programming, I started becoming more and more interested in another childhood game, Roblox. 
                    Roblox also allows the community to create games, and I thought it was amazing how these 3D games worked and behaved. I started
                    trying <cite>Roblox Studio</cite> for the first time.

                    For a while, I felt really overwhelmed with Roblox scripting: all I did was take free models made by the community. 
                    However, as I got more used to the environment, I started making an effort to watch tutorials about LUA from Youtubers 
                    like Alvinblox and TheDevKing. These individuals acted as mentors for me.

                    As I sought to learn more about Roblox LUA, such as client and server events, player scripts, workspace scripts, and more, I
                    started forming my first major creation: <span class="highlighter">Titan Legends</span>. The main goal of the game is to grow and defeat other players.

                    With the new school year in session, I had to put down Roblox for a while. However, this did not stop me from programming, and
                    I began to pick up Python. Learning from Youtubers such as CodingWithMosh and TechWithTim allowed me to utilize this language 
                    in Discord Bot development.

                    Additionally, I got to expand my knowledge with server uptime and data storage, something I was never concerned with before. 
                    TechWithTim specifically, helped me learn how to use mongoDB and Heroku to give my Discord bot more ability to help and entertain users.                 </p>

                    One of my high school teachers, Mr. Pham, recommended me to try out cybersecurity through a nation-wide competition called CyberStart. It 
                    was through this that I was able to learn about the other side of Computer Science: brute forcing, powerful operating systems like Linux, 
                    SQL injection, and so much more!
