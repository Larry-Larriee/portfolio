                    I started becoming more and more interested in another childhood game, Roblox. 
                    Roblox also allows the community to create games, and I thought it was amazing how these 3D games worked and behaved. I started
                    trying <cite>Roblox Studio</cite> for the first time.

                    For a while, I felt really overwhelmed with Roblox scripting: all I did was take free models made by the community. 
                    However, as I got more used to the environment, I started making an effort to watch tutorials about LUA from Youtubers 
                    like Alvinblox and TheDevKing. These individuals acted as mentors for me.

                    started forming my first major creation: <span class="highlighter"><a href="/projects/roblox/titan_legends.html">Titan Legends</a></span>. The main goal of the game is to grow and defeat other players.

                    With the new school year in session, I had to put down Roblox for a while. However, this did not stop me from programming, and
                    I began to pick up Python. Learning from Youtubers such as CodingWithMosh and TechWithTim allowed me to utilize this language 
                    in Discord Bot development.
